# Assets

Currently most art assets come from [Kenney](kenney.nl) and are free to use in open-source and commerical games.  Any art work made by LogicProjects is also being released as public domain works (apart from those derived from Kenney's tilesets)

Custom assets are also created for things like enemy combat encounters and room layouts to support designing the game without forcing recompilation.  In the future an external editor will be developed to allow for easier level design.  The perfect custom file format is Ron currently.
